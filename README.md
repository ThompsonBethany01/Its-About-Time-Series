# About the Project
## Background
Here at Big Research Co.®, we love data so much - everyone wears Fitbits, even our employees! We believe these watches are the next step in the Big Data Industry and help enhance our current research. Our research spans from fitness equiptment and drug trials to ~very ethical~ human experimentation.
## Goals
Everybody makes mistakes, even here at B.R.Co.®! Someone in a lab coat mixed up the labels for our Fitbit data, and one was left out. This Dr. Lab Coat handed me a usb containing the data in question. I need to determine what characteristics belong to the person wearing the Fitbit (did I mention it could be an employee or test subject?). That's not all, Dr. Lab Coat obscurley asked for predictions on the next two weeks of data that will be missing - missing because of the mix-up? Who knows, I just started here a week ago.
